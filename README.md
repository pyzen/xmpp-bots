XMPP Bots
=========

Simple XMPP bots for server management.

supervisorbot.py
----------------

The bot bridges XMPP and Supervisord's XML-RPC interface.  It provides
the same functionality as `supervisorctl`, but over XMPP.

systembot.py
------------

This bot can be configured to run basic shell commands and relay the
results back to you.  Useful for checking on system status.
